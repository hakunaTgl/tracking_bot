# Smart Bot Hub

Welcome to the **Smart Bot Hub**, a powerful Progressive Web App (PWA) for creating, managing, and deploying bots directly from your Android phone. Powered by an intelligent AI project manager, the hub generates complete, functional code, saves bots and logs persistently, and offers real-time conversational control. Whether you‚Äôre building a web scraper, weather bot, or custom automation, this hub puts you in command with a touch-friendly interface and no computer required.

## Features

- **Automatic Bot Saving**: Every bot is saved to local storage (IndexedDB) with name, code, analysis, status, and performance.
- **Full Code Generation**: Creates complete Python code (e.g., weather API clients, web scrapers) with detailed descriptions, error handling, and comments.
- **Conversational AI**: Real-time chat with intent detection‚Äîbuild bots, query hub status (e.g., ‚Äúlist running bots‚Äù), or have casual conversations.
- **Command System**: Send commands (Start, Stop, Restart) to individual bots or all bots globally via dropdown menus.
- **Functional Buttons**:
  - **Add Function**: Append features like logging or email notifications.
  - **Remove Function**: Delete specific functions from code.
  - **Edit**: Modify bot code directly.
  - **Refine/Suggest**: Get AI-driven tweaks and optimizations.
  - **Copy/Create**: Copy code or save bots to the hub.
- **AI-Driven Enhancements**: The AI suggests hub improvements (e.g., new dashboards) based on your inputs.
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Touch-friendly UI, bottom navigation, and offline support for saved data.
- **Persistent Logs**: All actions (e.g., code generation, commands) are logged and saved, with a clear option.

## Prerequisites

- **Android Phone**: Chrome browser (version 90+ recommended) for PWA support.
- **Internet Connection**: Required for initial setup and code generation (offline mode for UI and saved data).
- **GitHub Account**: Free account for hosting code.
- **Netlify Account**: Free account for deploying the PWA.

## Setup Instructions (Phone-Only)

Follow these steps to deploy the Smart Bot Hub on your Android phone using Chrome.

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

3. Tap ‚ÄúNew site from Git‚Äù or ‚ÄúSites‚Äù > ‚ÄúAdd new site.‚Äù
4. Select ‚ÄúGitHub,‚Äù choose your `bot-hub` repository.
5. Accept default settings (branch: `main`, no build command, publish directory: `/`).
6. Tap ‚ÄúDeploy site.‚Äù Wait ~1 minute for the URL (e.g., `https://your-bot-hub.netlify.app`).
7. **Time**: ~3-5 minutes.

### 4. Install as a PWA
1. Visit the Netlify URL in Chrome (e.g., `https://your-bot-hub.netlify.app`).
2. Tap the three-dot menu (top-right) > ‚ÄúAdd to Home screen‚Äù or ‚ÄúInstall app.‚Äù
3. Confirm to add the hub to your home screen.
4. Launch from the home screen for an app-like experience.
5. **Time**: ~1-2 minutes.

## Usage

1. **Launch the Hub**: Open the app from your home screen.

   - The AI detects intent: bot-building, hub queries, or casual chat.
   - Example: ‚Äúweather bot‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúCity? Daily or hourly updates?‚Äù
3. **Upload Ideas**:
   - Tap the file input to upload a text file (PDFs logged but not parsed).
   - Tap ‚ÄúGenerate from Input‚Äù to create code based on the file.
4. **Generate Code**:
   - Enter a prompt (e.g., ‚Äúweb scraper‚Äù) or use a file.
   - View complete Python code with a description (e.g., ‚ÄúScrapes website paragraphs‚Äù).
   - Analysis includes name, functions, value, and risks.
5. **Manage Bots**:
   - **Individual Commands**: Select ‚ÄúStart,‚Äù ‚ÄúStop,‚Äù or ‚ÄúRestart‚Äù from a bot‚Äôs dropdown.

8. Send a ‚ÄúStart‚Äù command to the bot.
9. Ask the AI, ‚Äúlist running bots,‚Äù to confirm status.
10. Check logs for all actions.

## Troubleshooting

- **GitHub Pasting Issues**:
  - Use Google Keep to store code, then paste.
  - Zoom in or type a few lines if the editor lags.
- **Netlify Deploy Fails**:
  - Ensure all files (`index.html`, `manifest.json`, `service-worker.js`) are in the repo‚Äôs root.
  - Check Netlify‚Äôs deploy logs in the dashboard.
- **PWA Not Installing**:
  - Update Chrome (Settings > Apps > Chrome).
  - Clear cache (Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data).
- **UI Issues**:
  - If buttons are small or text is unreadable, note your phone model (e.g., Galaxy S23) for tweaks.
  - Test scrolling in Bots and Logs sections.
- **File Uploads**:
  - Ensure Chrome has file access (Settings > Apps > Chrome > Permissions).
  - Use small text files for testing.
- **Offline Mode**:
  - UI and saved bots/logs work offline, but code generation needs internet.

## Future Enhancements

- **Real AI**: Integrate WebLLM or Hugging Face for true NLP (requires computer setup).
- **Code Execution**: Add Pyodide for in-browser Python runtime.
- **File Parsing**: Support PDFs with pdf.js.
- **Backend**: Deploy FastAPI with CodeLlama for advanced code generation.
- **UI Polish**: Custom icons, swipe gestures, analytics dashboard.
